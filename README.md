A multi-purpose discord BOT created to be useful and nice to use.

## Running

*I would prefer you don't run an instance of my bot, just join my server to use it, the code is open-source for educational purposes.*

Nevertheless, the installation steps are as follows:
1.  **Some things to know before running**

The project was developed on a Linux environment and it's highly recommended that you run it on the same.
Make sure you have Python3.10 or higher installed and [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html) installed via pip, you can install it using `$ python3.10 -m pip install --user virtualenv`

2.  **Clone this repository to your machine**

Run `$ git clone -b production https://github.com/SystemFalll/systembot` to get the production version (recommended).

Run `$ git clone -b development https://github.com/SystemFalll/systembot` to get the development version (not recommended).

3.  **Setup venv**

Access the project folder if you haven't already `$ cd gaymerbot` 
Then just do  `$ python3.10 -m virtualenv venv`

4.  **Install dependencies**

Activate the virtual enviroment by running `$ source venv/bin/activate`
And install the required dependencies  `$ python3.10 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

4.  **Create data files**

Run `$ mkdir data && mkdir data/logs && touch data/config.yaml`
See *base_config.yaml* for a basic config structure

5.  **Launching the bot**

Finally run the bot using `$ python3.10 launcher.py [--options]`
Options:
    `--debug`  launch with debug mode.
    `--help`  Show help message.
